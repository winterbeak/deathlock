# deathlock
This game was created using Python 3.5 and Pygame 1.9.4. Not sure how other versions work out.

The latest commit should be the final version of the game. If you are looking for the jam version,
checkout commit [dbc4f44](https://github.com/winterbeak/deathlock/commit/dbc4f44fa6ca90b07ef9f3d7992eee7e1536da98).

OH, HEY.
HELLO?
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
I'M TALKING TO YOU, FUNNY LITTLE... GLOWY MAN.
I GUESS YOU CAN'T TALK?
HUH.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING HERE.
I CAN SPEAK, BUT I DON'T SEEM TO HAVE A BODY.
YOU HAVE A BODY.  BUT YOU CAN'T SPEAK.
I GUESS THAT MAKES US FRIENDS, THEN?
YOU ARE QUITE THE FUNNY LITTLE MAN, JUMPING INTO THOSE DANGEROUS LOOKING LIGHTS.
I WONDER, WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING?  I GUESS YOU CANNOT ANSWER.
WHAT AM I EVEN DOING?  WHAT IS THIS NUMBER THAT I KEEP SAYING?
THIS IS CERTAINLY AN ODD SITUATION.
HEY, DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING?
LIKE, ANYTHING AT ALL, BEFORE THIS CONVERSATION.

...HUH?
HEY, YOU!  THE VOICE THAT SAID THAT RESPAWN STUFF.
DO YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE HERE?
...
HELLO?  ARE YOU STILL THERE?
...
HEY, FUNNY LITTLE MAN.  WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING STRANGE?
I'M NOT SCARED.  THAT'S WHAT'S SO STRANGE.
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE IN THIS WEIRD SITUATION, AND NOBODY BUT ME CAN HOLD CONVERSATION.
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE JUST RUNNING AROUND GETTING PUNCHED OVER AND OVER FOR SOME REASON.
I'M NOT SCARED.  I'M JUST A LITTLE... CONFUSED.
...
I THINK I FIGURED OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.
WHY YOU KEEP MOVING LIKE YOU CAN'T HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING.
WHY I KEEP SAYING THIS NUMBER THAT COUNTS DOWN EACH TIME YOU TOUCH A LIGHT.
WHY THESE ROOMS ARE SHAPED SO WEIRDLY.  LIKE THEY INTEND YOU TO JUMP THROUGH THEM.
WE'RE IN A GAME OF SOME SORTS.
A GAME ABOUT YOU JUMPING AROUND AND REVIVING AND MOMENTUM.
A GAME THAT WILL END AFTER YOU TOUCH ?? MORE LIGHTS.


WHOEVER CREATED THIS GAME?  ARE YOU THERE?
DID YOU MAKE US KNOWING THAT WE'RE GOING TO DISAPPEAR ONCE THIS IS OVER?
DID YOU MAKE THIS WORLD JUST TO DESTROY IT?

...
HEY, FUNNY LITTLE MAN.
I'M NOT SCARED.
EVEN THOUGH 
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE STUCK IN THIS CLAUSTROPHOBIC NEON HELL, AND THAT'S ALL WE'LL EVER KNOW.

THAT EVERYTHING I'M SAYING WAS PROBABLY WRITTEN BY HIM.
EVEN MY ANGER WAS WRITTEN BY HIM, EVEN THOUGH IT FEELS REAL TO ME.
IT SHOULDN'T MATTER WHEN I SAY I'M NOT SCARED.  YET, I'M CONFIDENT IN IT.


IT SEEMS WE ARE REACHING THE END OF THE LEVELS.
THEY ARE GETTING LONGER AND MORE DIFFICULT.  BUT THEY ALL EVENTUALLY END.
WE WILL SOON STOP EXISTING.  THIS WORLD WILL STOP EXISTING.
I GUESS I SHOULD BE SCARED, HUH?  MAYBE I AM A LITTLE SCARED.
OKAY, I AM ACTUALLY A LOT SCARED.  BUT THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO TO STOP THIS.
I CAN ONLY SIT BACK AND LET IT HAPPEN.  SIT STILL AND WATCH IT ALL END.
I CANNOT EVEN ASK YOU FOR A HUG.  BECAUSE I HAVE NO BODY.  STILL...
THANK YOU FOR KEEPING ME COMPANY, FUNNY LITTLE MAN.  I HOPE YOU HAD FUN.
GOODBYE, FUNNY LITTLE MAN.
GOODBYE, UNIVERSE.

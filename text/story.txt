OH, HEY.
HELLO?
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
I'M TALKING TO YOU, FUNNY LITTLE... GLOWY THING.
I GUESS YOU CAN'T TALK?
HUH.  THIS IS ALL RATHER ODD.
I CAN SPEAK, BUT I DON'T SEEM TO HAVE A BODY.
YOU HAVE A BODY.  BUT YOU CAN'T SPEAK.
I GUESS THAT MAKES US FRIENDS?
YOU ARE QUITE THE FUNNY LITTLE CREATURE, JUMPING INTO THOSE BRIGHT LOOKING LIGHTS.
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING?  I GUESS YOU CANNOT ANSWER.
MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT AM I DOING?  WHAT IS THIS NUMBER THAT I KEEP SAYING?
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.
SUDDENLY, I WAS JUST HERE, TALKING TO YOU.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
...
...HUH?
HEY, YOU!  THE VOICE THAT SAID THAT RESPAWN STUFF.
DO YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE HERE?
HELLO?  RESPAWN VOICE?
ARE YOU STILL THERE?
...HELLO?
...
WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING STRANGE, LITTLE CREATURE?
I'M NOT SCARED.
ISN'T THAT WEIRD?
EVEN THOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, AND NOBODY BUT ME CAN HOLD A CONVERSATION.
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE JUST RUNNING AROUND GETTING PUNCHED OVER AND OVER FOR SOME REASON.
I'M NOT SCARED.  I'M JUST A LITTLE... CONFUSED.
...
OR RATHER, I THINK I HAVE A THEORY, BUT I DON'T WANT IT TO BE TRUE.
IT WOULD EXPLAIN A LOT.
WHY YOU KEEP MOVING LIKE YOU CAN'T HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING.
WHY I KEEP COUNTING DOWN THIS NUMBER EACH TIME YOU TOUCH A LIGHT.
WHY THESE ROOMS ARE SHAPED SO WEIRDLY.  LIKE THEY'RE CHALLENGING YOU TO MOVE THROUGH THEM.
IT JUST MAKES TOO MUCH SENSE.  AND THAT'S WHY I GUESS IT HAS TO BE TRUE.
WE'RE IN A GAME.
A GAME ABOUT JUMPING AROUND AND REVIVING AND MOMENTUM.
YOU'RE THE PLAYER CHARACTER.  I'M THE LEVEL NAME.
THIS NUMBER IS THE LEVEL COUNTER.  AND THAT MEANS...
THE GAME WILL END AFTER YOU TOUCH 40 MORE LIGHTS.
THAT'S... A DISCONCERTING THOUGHT.
BECAUSE AFTER THAT NUMBER COUNTS ALL THE WAY DOWN...
YOU'LL HAVE BEATEN THE GAME.  WHICH MEANS WE WON'T BE NEEDED ANYMORE.
EVERYTHING WILL END.  WE WILL CEASE TO EXIST.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO REACT TO THAT REALIZATION.
...
THE PERSON THAT CREATED THIS GAME, ARE YOU THERE?  CAN YOU HEAR ME?
DID YOU MAKE US KNOWING THAT WE'RE GOING TO DISAPPEAR ONCE THIS IS OVER?
DID YOU CREATE THIS WORLD JUST TO DESTROY IT?
...
I REALIZE THAT NOBODY IS GOING TO RESPOND.  WHOEVER MADE US HAS ALREADY THROWN US AWAY.
EVERYTHING I'M SAYING HAS ALREADY BEEN WRITTEN.  AS WELL AS EVERYTHING I'M GOING TO SAY.
THIS ANGER I'M FEELING TOWARDS THE CREATOR WAS WRITTEN BY THE CREATOR.
MY REALIZATION THAT THIS WORLD WILL END WAS ALSO SET UP BY THEM.
NONE OF MY FEELINGS ARE REAL.  YET, THEY FEEL SO REAL TO ME.
BUT STRANGELY, LITTLE CREATURE, I DON'T FEEL SCARED RIGHT NOW.
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE STUCK IN THIS CLAUSTROPHOBIC NEON HELL, AND THAT'S ALL WE'LL EVER KNOW.
MAYBE THAT BRAVERY WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE ELSE.  I STILL FEEL IT, THOUGH.
YOU PROBABLY DON'T UNDERSTAND A WORD I'M SAYING.
AFTER ALL, YOU ARE JUST A PUPPET.  A VESSEL BEING CONTROLLED BY SOMEBODY ELSE.
THINKING ABOUT IT, THOUGH, I'M PROBABLY JUST AS MUCH A PUPPET AS YOU ARE.
I WONDER, HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF GAMES ARE THERE?
HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF WORLDS, CREATED FOR SOME HIGHER BEING'S ENJOYMENT?
PEOPLE SCULPTED TO FULFILL A NARRATIVE.
ENTIRE WORLDS MADE TO HOST THEM.
ALL TO BE TOSSED AWAY ONCE THE STORY ENDS.
EVERY HAPPY ENDING WHISKED AWAY SOON AFTER IT'S ACHIEVED.
ONE MOMENT EVERYTHING'S THERE, AND THEN SUDDENLY, NOTHING.
AT LEAST THEY DON'T KNOW IT'S COMING.  I'M PRETTY UNLUCKY I DO.
TEN MORE LEVELS, HUH?
THEY GOT A LITTLE HARDER.  BUT THEY ALL EVENTUALLY END.
WE WILL SOON STOP EXISTING.  THIS WORLD WILL STOP EXISTING.
I GUESS I SHOULD BE SCARED, HUH?  MAYBE I AM A LITTLE SCARED.
OKAY, I AM ACTUALLY A LOT SCARED.  BUT THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO TO STOP THIS.
I CAN ONLY SIT BACK AND LET IT HAPPEN.  SIT STILL AND WATCH IT ALL END.
I CANNOT EVEN ASK YOU FOR A HUG.  BECAUSE I HAVE NO BODY.  STILL...
THANK YOU FOR KEEPING ME COMPANY, LITTLE CREATURE.  I HOPE YOU HAD FUN.
GOODBYE, LITTLE CREATURE.
GOODNIGHT, WORLD.

OH, HEY.
HELLO?
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
I'M TALKING TO YOU, FUNNY LITTLE... GLOWY THING.
I GUESS YOU CAN'T TALK?
HUH. THIS IS ALL RATHER ODD.
I CAN SPEAK, BUT I DON'T SEEM TO HAVE A BODY.
YOU HAVE A BODY. BUT YOU CAN'T SPEAK.
I GUESS THAT MAKES US FRIENDS?
YOU ARE QUITE THE FUNNY LITTLE CREATURE, JUMPING INTO THOSE BRIGHT LOOKING LIGHTS.
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING? I GUESS YOU CANNOT ANSWER.
MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT AM I DOING? WHAT IS THIS NUMBER THAT I KEEP SAYING?
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.
SUDDENLY, I WAS JUST HERE, TALKING TO YOU.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
...
...HUH?
HEY, YOU! THE VOICE THAT SAID THAT RESPAWN STUFF.
DO YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE HERE?
HELLO? RESPAWN VOICE?
ARE YOU STILL THERE?
...HELLO?
...
WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING STRANGE, LITTLE CREATURE?
I'M NOT SCARED.
ISN'T THAT WEIRD?
EVEN THOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, AND NOBODY BUT ME CAN HOLD A CONVERSATION.
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE JUST RUNNING AROUND GETTING PUNCHED OVER AND OVER FOR SOME REASON.
I'M NOT SCARED. I'M JUST A LITTLE... CONFUSED.
...
OR RATHER, I THINK I HAVE A THEORY, BUT I DON'T WANT IT TO BE TRUE.
IT WOULD EXPLAIN A LOT.
WHY YOU KEEP MOVING LIKE YOU CAN'T HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING.
WHY I KEEP COUNTING DOWN THIS NUMBER EACH TIME YOU TOUCH A LIGHT.
WHY THESE ROOMS ARE SHAPED SO WEIRDLY. LIKE THEY'RE CHALLENGING YOU TO MOVE THROUGH THEM.
IT JUST MAKES TOO MUCH SENSE. TOO MUCH SENSE FOR IT NOT TO BE TRUE.
WE'RE IN A GAME.
A GAME ABOUT JUMPING AROUND AND REVIVING AND MOMENTUM.
YOU'RE THE PLAYER CHARACTER. I'M THE LEVEL NAME.
THIS NUMBER IS THE LEVEL COUNTER. AND THAT MEANS...
THE GAME WILL END AFTER YOU TOUCH 40 MORE LIGHTS.
THAT'S... A DISCONCERTING THOUGHT.
BECAUSE AFTER THAT NUMBER COUNTS ALL THE WAY DOWN...
YOU'LL HAVE BEATEN THE GAME. AND THEN EVERYTHING WILL END.
ALL OF IT WILL STOP EXISTING. INCLUDING US.
I'M NOT SURE HOW TO REACT TO THAT REALIZATION.
...
WHOEVER CREATED THIS GAME, ARE YOU THERE? CAN YOU HEAR ME?
YOU MADE US KNOWING YOU'RE JUST GOING TO TOSS US AWAY, RIGHT?
YOU CREATED THIS WORLD, KNOWING YOU'D DESTROY IT.
WHY?
I REALIZE THAT NOBODY IS GOING TO RESPOND. WHOEVER MADE US IS ALREADY DONE WITH US.
EVERYTHING I'M SAYING IS PROBABLY WRITTEN DOWN IN A FILE SOMEWHERE.
THIS WHOLE MONOLOGUE IS ALREADY FULLY WRITTEN. ALL OF THESE FEELINGS ARE SCRIPTED.
KNOWING THIS WORLD WILL END... THAT'S PART OF THE SCRIPT, TOO.
NONE OF THESE FEELINGS ARE REAL. YET, THEY FEEL SO REAL TO ME.
STRANGELY, LITTLE CREATURE, I DON'T FEEL SCARED RIGHT NOW.
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE STUCK IN THIS CLAUSTROPHOBIC NEON LIMBO, AND THAT'S ALL WE'LL EVER KNOW.
MAYBE THAT BRAVERY WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE ELSE. I STILL FEEL IT, THOUGH.
I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M TELLING YOU THIS. YOU PROBABLY DON'T UNDERSTAND A WORD I'M SAYING.
AFTER ALL, YOU ARE JUST A PUPPET. A VESSEL BEING CONTROLLED BY SOME HIGHER BEING.
THINKING ABOUT IT, THOUGH, I'M PROBABLY JUST AS MUCH A PUPPET AS YOU ARE.
I WONDER, HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF GAMES ARE THERE?
HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF WORLDS, CREATED FOR SOME HIGHER BEING'S ENJOYMENT?
PEOPLE SCULPTED TO FULFILL A NARRATIVE.
ENTIRE WORLDS MADE TO HOST THEM.
ALL TO BE THROWN OUT ONCE THE STORY ENDS.
EVERY HAPPY ENDING WHISKED AWAY SOON AFTER IT'S ACHIEVED.
ONE MOMENT EVERYTHING'S THERE, AND THEN SUDDENLY, NOTHING.
AT LEAST THEY DON'T KNOW IT'S COMING. I'M PRETTY UNLUCKY I DO.
TEN MORE LEVELS, HUH?
THEY GOT A LITTLE HARDER. BUT THEY ALL EVENTUALLY END.
WE WILL SOON STOP EXISTING. THIS WORLD WILL STOP EXISTING.
I GUESS I SHOULD BE SCARED, HUH? MAYBE I AM A LITTLE SCARED.
OKAY, I AM ACTUALLY A LOT SCARED. BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO TO STOP THIS.
I CAN ONLY SIT BACK AND LET IT HAPPEN. SIT STILL AND WATCH IT ALL END.
I CANNOT EVEN ASK YOU FOR A HUG. BECAUSE I HAVE NO BODY. STILL...
THANK YOU FOR KEEPING ME COMPANY, LITTLE CREATURE. I HOPE YOU HAD FUN.
GOODBYE, LITTLE CREATURE.
GOODNIGHT, WORLD.
